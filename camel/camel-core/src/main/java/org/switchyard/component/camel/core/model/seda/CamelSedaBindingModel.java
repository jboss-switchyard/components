/**
 * Represents the configuration settings for a SEDA endpoint in Camel. 
 * 
 * The SEDA component provides asynchronous SEDA behavior, so that messages 
 * are exchanged on a BlockingQueue and consumers are invoked in a separate 
 * thread from the producer. 
 * Note that queues are only visible within a single CamelContext. If you 
 * want to communicate across CamelContext instances (for example, 
 * communicating between Web applications), see the VM component. This 
 * component does not implement any kind of persistence or recovery, if 
 * the VM terminates while messages are yet to be processed. If you need 
 * persistence, reliability or distributed SEDA, try using either JMS 
 * or ActiveMQ.
