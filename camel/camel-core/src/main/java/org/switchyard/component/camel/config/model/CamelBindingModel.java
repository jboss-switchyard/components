/**
 * A binding definition that specifies how communication between Apache Camel
 * and SwitchYard components is done.
 * 
 * Example of a binding implementation:
 * <pre>{
 *  <sca:service name="SimpleCamelService">
 *     <camel:binding.xyz>
 *        <camel:operationSelector operationName="print"/>
 *     </camel:binding.xyz>
 *  </sca:service>
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> The operationsSelector can be used to specify an operation name of the target 
 * service. 
 * This is required when you have components are consumers where there is
 * no way for the the operation name to be derived. For example, this might be the case when 
 * you are using the file component. This way you can specify the target operation name statically. 
 * This is an option element as there can be case when the target service can be derived. An example 
 * of this could be an webservice component where the operation name can be derived from the incoming
 * SOAPMessage and the WSDL.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
