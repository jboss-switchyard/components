 * which is similar to jMock in that it allows declarative expectations 
 * to be created on any Mock endpoint before a test begins. Then the test 
 * is run, which typically fires messages to one or more endpoints, and 
 * finally the expectations can be asserted in a test case to ensure the 
 * system worked as expected.
