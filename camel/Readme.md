# SwitchYard Camel Component
This project deals with integrating Apache Camel with SwitchYard.

## Using Apache Camel components as gateways/entrypoint into SwitchYard
    <switchyard 
        xmlns="urn:switchyard-config:switchyard:1.0"
        xmlns:camel="urn:switchyard-component-camel:config:1.0" 
        xmlns:sca="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/opencsa/sca/200912" 
        xmlns:bean="urn:switchyard-component-bean:config:1.0">

        <sca:composite>
            <sca:service name="SimpleCamelService">
                <camel:binding.camel configURI="direct://input">
                    <camel:operationSelector operationName="print"/>
                </camel:binding.camel>
            </sca:service>
        
            <sca:component name="ComponentName">
                <bean:implementation.bean class="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.SimpleCamelServiceImpl"/>
                <sca:service name="SimpleCamelService">
                    <sca:interface.java interface="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.SimpleCamelService"/>
                </sca:service>
            </sca:component>
        
        </sca:composite>

    </switchyard>
In the configuration above you see an example of a service that is using a Camel binding. What will happen is that SwitchYard
will create a CamelContext add add a route for the configured component, which is identified in this case using the *configUri*
attribute. This route will look like this for the above configuration:

    from("direct://input").to("switchyard://SimpleCamelService?operationName=print");
    
The *operationName* is optional if the Service only has a single method and can left out in that case.

## Using SwitchYard reference bindings with Apache Camel
A configuration of a reference binding could look like this:
    <switchyard 
        xmlns="urn:switchyard-config:switchyard:1.0"
        xmlns:camel="urn:switchyard-component-camel:config:1.0" 
        xmlns:sca="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/opencsa/sca/200912" 
        xmlns:bean="urn:switchyard-component-bean:config:1.0">
        
        <sca:composite>
        
            <sca:reference name="WarehouseService" promote="OrderComponent/WarehouseService">
                <camel:binding.camel configURI="vm://warehouseStatusService"/>
            </sca:reference>
            
            <sca:component name="OrderComponent">
                <bean:implementation.bean class="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.OrderServiceImpl"/>
                <sca:service name="OrderService">
                    <sca:interface.java interface="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.OrderService"/>
                </sca:service>
                <sca:reference name="WarehouseService">
                    <sca:interface.java interface="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.WarehouseService"/>
                </sca:reference>
            </sca:component>
            
        </sca:composite>
    
    </switchyard>
In this configuration we have defined a reference binding which has specified a configURI attribute which identifies the
Camel endpoint to be called. The *OrderComponent* is configured with an implementation of the *OrderService* interface and
a concreate implementation of *OrderServiceImpl*:

    public interface OrderService {
        public String getTitleForItem(String itemId);
    }
    
    import javax.inject.Inject;

    import org.switchyard.component.bean.Reference;
    import org.switchyard.component.bean.Service;
    
    @Service(OrderService.class)
    public class OrderServiceImpl implements OrderService {
        
        @Inject @Reference
        WarehouseService _warehouseService;
    
        @Override
        public String getTitleForItem(String itemId) {
            return _warehouseService.hasItem(itemId);
        }
    }
Notice that *OrderServiceImpl* requires a *WarehouseService* instance. This is declared in the configuration using the
reference element on the *OrderComponent* and SwitchYard will inject a proxy that will delegate to the Camel endpoint.

## Using SwitchYard implementation.camel with Apache Camel
A Camel route can be used as the implementation for a service. This is done by using the *implementation.camel* element which can contain a Camel route.
SwitchYard takes care of creating a service for the interface which sole purpose is to trigger the Camel route. It does this by creating a *from* route 
that triggers the Camel route. This allows SwitchYard clients to use the service interface to invoke the Camel route.

For example:

    <sd:switchyard 
        xmlns="urn:switchyard-component-camel:config:1.0" 
        xmlns:sca="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/opencsa/sca/200912" 
        xmlns:sd="urn:switchyard-config:switchyard:1.0"
        xmlns:bean="urn:switchyard-component-bean:config:1.0">

        <sca:composite>
    
            <sca:component name="WarehouseComponent" >
                <bean:implementation.bean class="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.WarehouseServiceImpl"/>
                <sca:service name="WarehouseService" promote="WarehouseService">
                    <sca:interface.java interface="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.WarehouseService"/>
                </sca:service>
            </sca:component>
        
            <sca:component name="CamelComponent">
                <sca:service name="OrderService" >
                    <sca:interface.java interface="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.OrderService"/>
                </sca:service>
                
                <sca:reference name="WarehouseService">
                    <sca:interface.java interface="org.switchyard.component.camel.deploy.support.WarehouseService"/>
                </sca:reference>
                
                <implementation.camel>
                    <route xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring" id="Camel Test Route">
                        <log message="ItemId [${body}]"/>
                        <to uri="switchyard://WarehouseService?operationName=hasItem"/>
                        <log message="Title Name [${body}]"/>
                    </route>
                </implementation.camel>
            </sca:component>
        
        </sca:composite>

    </sd:switchyard>
As you can see in the above configuration that the route in *implementation.camel* does not contain a *from* route. Switchyard will add a *from* route for the service.

The above would be invokable by using the following code from a SwitchYard test:

    String title = newInvoker("OrderService").operation("getTitleForItem").sendInOut("10").getContent(String.class);
    
Running the above code snippet would generate the following in you console log:

    10:57:45,915 INFO  [impl.DefaultCamelContext] Apache Camel 2.6.0 (CamelContext: camel-1) started in 0.838 seconds
    10:57:46,284 INFO  [impl.DefaultCamelContext] Route: Camel Test Route started and consuming from: Endpoint[switchyard://OrderService]
    10:57:46,307 INFO  [impl.DefaultCamelContext] Apache Camel 2.6.0 (CamelContext: camel-1) is starting
    10:57:46,307 INFO  [impl.DefaultCamelContext] Total 1 routes, of which 1 is started.
    10:57:46,307 INFO  [impl.DefaultCamelContext] Apache Camel 2.6.0 (CamelContext: camel-1) started in 0.000 seconds
    10:57:46,428 INFO  [Camel Test Route] ItemId [10]
    10:57:46,434 INFO  [Camel Test Route] Title Name [Fletch]

Notice the Camel Endpoint **switchyard://OrderService**, this is the endpoint that SwitchYard generates and can be configured by setting the schema property like demonstrated above.

## SwitchYard Transformers and Camel's TypeConverters
SwitchYard has build in transformers and custom transformers can be registered with the runtime. Camel has TypeConverters
that basically perform similar tasks. 

SwitchYards Camel component provides a SwitchYard transformer that delegates to Camel's TypeConverters. To accomplish this the different type of converters have to be registered with SwitchYard as transformers. This is currently a static file, *META-INF/switchyard/transforms.xml* 
which is parsed by SwitchYard. In future versions these will be dynamically registred with SwitchYard.

If users have customer Camel TypeConverters they can be specified by either adding them to the transforms.xml in the SwitchYard Camel component or they 
can add a transforms.xml to there deployment archive.

## Calling a SwitchYard service from Apache Camel:
    <camelContext id="camelContext" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">

        <route id="fromCamelComponent">
            <from uri="direct:input"/>
            <log message="From Camel Component body: ${body}"/>
            <to uri="switchyard://serviceName?operationName=operationName"/>
        </route>

    </camelContext>
